in developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.	

Since the firsthuman gazed up at the night sky, human being have never stopped acquiring knowledge and attempting to understand the surrounding world. However, there is a claim that as people gain more knowledge, thing do not become more comprehensible but rather more complex and mysterious. I believe that knowledge does not make things more complex but rather reshapes our perception, However, in the process of acquiring knowledge, some things can become more comprehensible while new mystery emerges.
There is a difference between complexity and incomprehensibility. Although it is undeniably more challenging to understand a complicated object, being difficult to grasp does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to comprehend. Has the world become more complex as we come to know more about it? I doubt this is a case, because the world's complexity does not depend on our comprehension level. F or example, rules governing the movements of stars have been always the same, from the time of the first stargazer, but understanding of these laws has improved. Reductionists may argue that knowledge simplifies our understanding but this view does not always hold true because we have not discovered every piece of information about the physical world. That is, as people acquire more knowledge ,new information emerges which makes things more complex to them.
As mentioned above, incomprehensibility does not arise from complex. 
On the other hand, new knowledge often raises new questions which cannot be answered without further inquiry.
The fact that new knowledge raises new questions does not suggest that we are unable to understand.
As I have discussed, the world does not become more complex as a result of new knowledge of new knowledge but instead we gain a more comprehensive perception of it. New knowledge can indeed explain things we once found mysterious, but at the same time, it raises new, often puzzling questions. However, those questions are only mysterious until the are solved.

## 因果类
write a response in which you discuss the extend to which you agree or disagree which the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.

In modern society where media coverage is ubiquitous, there is a claim that no living men or women can be regarded as heroes because their reputations, when subjected to media scrutiny, will eventually be diminished. In my opinion, it is undeniable true that media scrutiny is capable of deteriorating one's reputation; however, such abilities do not necessarily mean a hero's positive image will collapse. Even if heroes' imperfections are revealed, society may still regard living men or women as heroes. 
In the first place, no man is perfect and "to err is human", says Alexander Pope. Therefore, if every aspect of one's life is exposed to the public by the media, his or her reputation could certainly be compromised. Some of his or her behaviors may not be accepted as the moral standard for a hero. For example, a brave, heroic firefighter who is willing to risk his own life to save others' might be committing adultery, which, if revealed, would result in his reputation be defamed. Also, the media may exaggerate a heroes' negative side in order to gain more publicity. In such extreme cases, media scrutiny could focus on a hero's derogatory remarks and bias -public opinion towards him or her.
That being said, the argument above assumes that the media will excessively probe into the heroes' personalities in details and/or focus on th negative. This assumption, however, could be wrong. With regard to the first part, media may not be willing to invest time and resources discovering every negative aspect of a hero's life due to limited resources and perhaps weak pubic public resonance it can provoke. Furthermore, it would be unfair to assume that every media source is biased in this way. Thanks to the first Amendment, there are many independent media sources in the United States providing information from different angles. Even if politically motivated, it would be almost impossible to require or force all media to dedicate its coverage to a hero's dark side. 
Even if a hero's reputation is diminished to some extend by media scrutiny, it is still necessary for society to regard him or her as a hero. To understand this claim, we need to revisit the definition of hero. heroes are those who possess essential qualities which are admired by people. In other words, it is those particular qualities, such as valor, self-sacrifice, and commitment to public interest, that make a man or woman a hero. Therefore, as long as those key qualities are not falsified by the media, heroes can exist despite negativity concerning their personalities. Let's return to the aforementioned imaginary firefighter who has extramarital affair. If he indeed saves other's lives by sacrificing his own in a blaze, it is not surprising at all that he will be regarded as a hero. It is the valor and commitment demonstrated through him paying the ultimate price that outweigh the stain on his character and earn him the title of hero. 
To summarize, it is true that media scrutiny has the potential to diminish one's reputation. Because men are inherently imperfect, the media could deliberately focus on the negatives but this cannot be guaranteed. The media may necessarily broadcast only negative aspects intended to destroy a hero's positive image. Even if the media did so, the public would still accept them because they possess key characteristics that define them as heroes.
